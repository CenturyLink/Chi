  | The Lumen Chi Accessibility Foundations checklist defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.

p.-text
  | Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and 
  | neurological disabilities. According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html" rel="noopener">CDC</a>,
  | 1 in 4 adults in the United States have some type of functional disability.

h2 Key concepts
h3 Using the keyboard
p.-text
  | The website or application must be completely usable through a keyboard. There can be nothing which requires a mouse.  Blind users who
  | rely on screen readers navigate by using the keyboard. In addition, some users who see the screen perfectly well have impaired motor
  | skills which make it difficult or impossible to control a mouse.

h3 Page structure
p.-text
  | Well-structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use HTML and WAI-ARIA to improve navigation and orientation
  | on web pages and in applications. Mark up should include page regions, labeling regions, headings and content structure.

h3 Color and sensory
p.-text
  | Enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as non-visually-impaired people.

h3 Images
p.-text
  | Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them.

h3 Text
p.-text
  | Genuine text is much more flexible than images: It can be resized without losing clarity, and background and text colors can be modified
  | to suit the reading preferences of users. Images are more likely to distort and pixelate when resized.

h3 Links and forms
p.-text
  | Users usually prefer simple and short forms. Only ask users to enter what is required to complete the transaction or process; if irrelevant
  | or excessive data is requested, users are more likely to abandon the form.

h3 Tables
p.-text
  | Accessible tables need HTML structural markup that indicates header cells and data cells and defines their relationship. Assistive Technologies
  | use this information to provide context to users.

h3 Others
ul.-text
  li <strong>Time-based Media:</strong> Provide alternatives for time-based media.
  li <strong>Distinguishable:</strong> Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
  li <strong>Enough Time:</strong> Provide users enough time to read and use content.
  li <strong>Seizures:</strong> Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.

p.-text
  | CenturyLink is required to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a>), Conformance
  | leves A and AA success criteria. These guidelines and their success criteria will also satisfy the Revised <a target="_blank" href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a>
  | of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act (as of January 18, 2018).

p.-text
  | Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees and combinations
  | of disability. These guidelines also make web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve 
  | usability for users in general.

h3 About assistive technologies
p.-text
  | Technologies that allow people with disabilities to use a resource are known as assistive technologies. Perhaps the most commonly thought of type of
  | assistive technology for the web are screen readers, which process the visible (and sometimes invisible) elements on the screen and read the
  | information aloud to the user. The three most popular screen readers are JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver (iOS). Other examples of assistive technologies
  | used on the web include Braille translation devices, screen magnifiers, closed captioning and specialized keyboards.
