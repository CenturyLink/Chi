            li Keyboard Navigation: Support navigation through hours, minutes, and optionally seconds using arrow keys, and allow selection with the "Enter" key.
            li Use <code>label</code> Elements: Provide descriptive labels for each select component involved in time picking. Ensure the <code>for</code> attribute of the label matches the <code>id</code> of the associated input or select box to support screen readers.
            li Use appropriate ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility. For example, <code>role="listbox"</code> for the select element and <code>role="option"</code> for each option within hour, minute, and second dropdowns.
            li Error Handling and Feedback: Provide clear and immediate feedback for actions such as selection errors. Use ARIA live regions to announce updates or errors dynamically.
            li Test compatibility with various screen readers (like JAWS, NVDA, or VoiceOver) to ensure the time picker component is announced correctly. Options should be clearly read out when navigated.
            li Implement visible focus styles to help keyboard users determine which element has focus.

            li Ensure all interactive elements in the time picker, like hour and minute selections and navigation buttons, meet the minimum target size of 44x44 pixels, as recommended by WCAG 2.5.5.
            li Design elements with adequate spacing to prevent accidental activations.
            li Design the time picker with high contrast between text and background colors, ensuring a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text.
            li Employ distinct visual styles for error states using icons, text styles, and colors to clearly denote and explain errors like invalid dates or format issues.
            li Implement noticeable focus indicators on interactive elements, using enhanced borders, outlines, or shadows to clearly mark the active element during keyboard navigation.
            li Use spacing, typography, and visual cues effectively.
            li Maintain consistency in the design of the time picker to provide a cohesive user experience.
