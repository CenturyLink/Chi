      | Chi defines 5 different viewports: XS, SM, MD, LG and XL. By default, 
      | columns in a grid container behave the same across viewport sizes. 
      | You will often want to change the layout based on the user's current 
      | viewport. You may accomplish this by setting viewport-specific 
      | classes to each of your columns that denote sizing or layout 
      | preferences for the viewport or viewports you are concerned with changing.

      |It is important to note that viewport-specific classes apply to their 
      | respective viewport and any larger viewport (unless overridden by a 
      | larger viewport class). For example, specifying <code>-w-md--6</code> 
      | would apply a width of 6 units to the column in MD, LG and XL viewports.
