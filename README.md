# Welcome to Chi

Chi is Lumen's design system for building consistent digital products and experiences.

## Getting Started

Integrating Chi with your project is as simple as loading the Chi stylesheet from the [Lumen Assets Server](https://assets.ctl.io). Not only is this a great way to get started with Chi, it is also a highly available and performant option for loading the required assets into your project.

Begin by adding the Chi stylesheet to your project's layout template, replacing `VERSION` with the most recent release of Chi:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://assets.ctl.io/chi/VERSION/chi.css">
```

Next, add the `chi` CSS class to the `<html>` tag of your document to properly scope the styles. This allows Chi to override any existing styles that have been defined by legacy markup.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html class="chi">
  ...
</html>
```

At this point you will be able to target the styles available in Chi by referencing its [documentation](https://assets.ctl.io/chi).

## Development Workflow

Set up your Chi development environment with Docker. First make sure you have Docker installed, then run the command:

``` sh
$ scripts/docker.sh alias
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now your environment is set up. To start development run:

``` sh
$ chi start
```

Once the container has been bootstrapped and the Chi project has started, connect to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to load Chi. While running, any changes to the Chi source will automatically be reloaded in your browser.

The project has been configured to run inside a Docker container so it won't work as a regular node application.

### Steps for Linux (Ubuntu)

- install docker https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/
- change this in the [docker.sh](/scripts/docker.sh) script:
  - `REPO_PATH=$(cd $(dirname $0)/..; pwd)` -> `REPO_PATH=$(pwd)`
  - `bash_profile` -> `profile`
- run:
``` sh
  . scripts/docker.sh alias
  source ~/.bash_profile
  chi start
 ```

## Testing Changes

We use [BackstopJS](https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS) for visual regression testing of our CSS components. In order to account for differences in development environments we always run these tests in a consistent Docker container. To execute the test suite, run the following command:

``` sh
$ chi test
```

A report containing the results of the test will be created under `reports/html_report`. If there were failures, you will need to visually examine the changes and act appropriately based on the anticipated results.

If you receive a test failure and you've made changes that you know are correct, you will need to override the test references with your new changes by running the `approve` command on BackstopJS:

``` sh
$ chi approve
```

Once you have approved the changes, commit the new reference files with your changes.

## Production

Use the build command to make a ready-to-production build:

``` sh
$ chi build
```

## License

Chi and its documentation are released under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE).

In addition, Chi uses several 3rd-party libraries, a list of which can be viewed in the [package.json](package.json) file. Please review each of their license and user agreements, as well.
