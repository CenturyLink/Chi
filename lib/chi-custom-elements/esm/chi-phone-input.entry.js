// For some reason Google's metadata contains `<intlFormat/>`s with brackets and dashes.
// Meanwhile, there's no single opinion about using punctuation in international phone numbers.
//
// For example, Google's `<intlFormat/>` for USA is `+1 213-373-4253`.
// And here's a quote from WikiPedia's "North American Numbering Plan" page:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan
//
// "The country calling code for all countries participating in the NANP is 1.
// In international format, an NANP number should be listed as +1 301 555 01 00,
// where 301 is an area code (Maryland)."
//
// I personally prefer the international format without any punctuation.
// For example, brackets are remnants of the old age, meaning that the
// phone number part in brackets (so called "area code") can be omitted
// if dialing within the same "area".
// And hyphens were clearly introduced for splitting local numbers into memorizable groups.
// For example, remembering "5553535" is difficult but "555-35-35" is much simpler.
// Imagine a man taking a bus from home to work and seeing an ad with a phone number.
// He has a couple of seconds to memorize that number until it passes by.
// If it were spaces instead of hyphens the man wouldn't necessarily get it,
// but with hyphens instead of spaces the grouping is more explicit.
// I personally think that hyphens introduce visual clutter,
// so I prefer replacing them with spaces in international numbers.
// In the modern age all output is done on displays where spaces are clearly distinguishable
// so hyphens can be safely replaced with spaces without losing any legibility.

// "Check that we didn't remove nor add any extra digits when we matched
// this formatting pattern. This usually happens after we entered the last
// digit during AYTF. Eg: In case of MX, we swallow mobile token (1) when
// formatted but AYTF should retain all the number entered and not change
// in order to match a format (of same leading digits and length) display
// in that way."
// "If it's the same (i.e entered number and format is same), then it's
// safe to return this in formatted number as nothing is lost / added."
// Otherwise, don't use this format.

      // If you don’t add the “1”, you’ll receive a recorded announcement
